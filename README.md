Hi there üôå

#### Can you help?

I am thinking of something to do for my graduation bachelor thesis. I want it to be something of use, not just a sparkled up version of the projects from previous courses which are, for me, meant to be for training only.
Ideally it would be something that uses tech to helps arts and cultures accessible to more people on Earth. This helps educate people about the arts, and also provides creatives something to reach their audiences. A win-win kind of thing.

My inspiration is from [Experiments with Google](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/) and [Google Creative Lab 5](https://www.creativelab5.com/). You can check them out to better understand what I mean here.

The problem is that I do not have a very good picture of what people really want to get out of these kind of things, or what is something they've been hoping that it existed. In other words, I do not know which kind of a project would be practical and useful for people out there.

If you will, please drop a message of an idea, a suggestion, or a reference that you think is helpful to my email. Thank you so much!

With love ‚ù§Ô∏è

Tieu
